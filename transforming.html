   <h1>Origami Transforming Shuriken:</h1>
   <p>This 8 point ninja star (or 8 sided ninja star) is one of the coolest origami you'll ever learn to fold. What makes this shuriken so special is that it can also transform into some sort of round blade or frisbee. This makes the shuriken a very dangerous under cover weapon. Oh yeah, it's dangerous because the points are very sharp, so watch where you throw it.</p>
